## Review üëì

Congratulations! You've completed the `creme-brulee` ComplyTime learning course and learned a lot about the supporting projects. You learned about the projects that build the foundation for ComplyTime tools and how to edit OSCAL Component Definitions in Markdown. You gained Git Flow experience through creation of branches, Pull Requests, and Markdown content. You're encouraged to continue your lasting learning journey through expanding your knowledge on Markdown and Git Flow.

### What's next? ‚è≠Ô∏è

- Review what you learned in your copy of the `creme-brulee` ComplyTime learning course. The issue that was automatically created when you first clicked "Start Exercise" is now in the same "Issues" tab, but once you opened the issue for taking notes - it was moved to "Closed." Find your issue under the "Closed" tab.
- Retry this exercise! Practicing only helps here. This is a public repository template so you can retry this exercise as often as you'd like. 
- Ask questions. The Slack channel for the learning course will be [#learn-complytime](https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C093B45QGQM)
