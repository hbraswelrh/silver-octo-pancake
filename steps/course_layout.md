# Course Layout

Welcome to the ComplyTime learning course! This guide will help you navigate the course, which is built on GitHub Skills and uses automated workflows to set up your personalized workspace. You'll use GitHub Issues to keep track of your notes as you progress.

## **üìö Reading `creme-brulee` Course Documentation**

This is the _first_ step of the learning course. Get started by reviewing the docs that will set the stage for your learning journey within the `creme-brulee` project.


### **‚úÖ Mandatory Review Materials for Course Completion**

Ensure you've reviewed these foundational resources for your success in the course.

Document your notes in a GitHub issue like [this](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/quickstart). Ensure you select "Learning course issue template" when opening your issue.

### **üìù Take the Self-Assessment**

Once you've thoroughly reviewed all the documentation above, take this short [self-assessment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdE4qJ3pmWa1SaQoWMiUI9p3ZdB947PbhqZEIFo7nWYdcJ44A/viewform?usp=header). Good luck\! üöÄ

#### **Taking Notes**

As you go through the documentation, it's highly recommended that you take detailed notes. Your personal workspace, created by the automated workflows, allows you to use GitHub Issues for this purpose.

* To document your notes, create a new GitHub Issue.  
* **Important:** When creating your issue, make sure to select the "**Learning course issue template**." This will help you keep your notes organized and consistent.  
* You can refer to [this example](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/quickstart) for guidance on how to create an issue.


### Example :speech_balloon:

##### Refresh page once you've made your copy of the `creme-brulee` repository.

## Taking notes using GitHub Issues

> Taking notes in an issue will help with comfortability using Git and practicing with Markdown. 

### Navigation

Navigate to the Issues tab. Click the green "New issue" box in the top right corner.

<img alt="img.png" height="190" src="images/newissuepic.png" width="300"/>

Open an issue using the "Learning course issue template."

<img alt="img.png" height="190" src="images/issuelctemplate.png" width="300"/>

### Update the template content

Update the content and the `{REPLACE_ME}` areas with your Key Concepts. Click "Create" to create your issue. This will track your notes while completing Step 1: _Read the docs_. 

<img alt="img.png" height="280" src="images/replaceme.png" width="350"/>

### Next Steps 

Once you have taken notes and completed the self-assessment for Step 1: Read the docs, copy the link of your issue and paste it in the comments of your Exercise: Read the docs issue.

<img alt="img.png" height="190" src="images/availableimage.png" width="310"/>

Click "Comment." That comment will trigger Step 2 to populate in the issue body.

<img alt="img.png" height="100" src="images/commenterbody.png" width="350"/>

#### Comment the link to your note-taking issue to populate Step 2.

<img alt="img_5.png" height="400" src="https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/f57b896a9898162d80e34ba6abca85fcc0da4930/steps/images/comment.png" width="400"/>

## Step 2: Practice communicating using Markdown and Git

Comment the link to your note-taking issue on the exercise issue once finishing Step 1: _Read the Docs_. The next step will populate after around 20 seconds. 

<img alt="img_3.png" height="400" src="images/issuecommenttrigger.png" width="400"/>

##### Populating step 2

<img alt="img_1.png" height="400" src="images/step2populate.png" width="400"/>

##### Follow the directions in the issue body

<img alt="img.png" height="400" src="images/followdirections.png" width="400"/>

### Branching 

##### Navigate back to the homepage to create a new branch. 

<img alt="img.png" height="400" src="images/gotohome.png" width="440"/>

##### Click "View All Branches." The branch `main` should be the only branch in your workspace.

<img alt="img_1.png" height="340" src="images/branchesviewbefore.png" width="500"/>

##### Click the green button in the top right corner that says "New Branch." 

<img alt="img.png" height="360" src="images/singlemainbranch.png" width="550"/>

##### Create a new branch named "`learn-complytime/step-2`"

> This step is _crucial_ for the course to work. Ensure you create the branch name exactly as `learn-complytime/step-2`.

<img alt="img_1.png" height="350" src="images/learn-complytimebranchname.png" width="550"/>

Click "Create new branch." The default "Source" will be the main branch. That means that the main branch will be copied to your new `learn-complytime/step-2` branch. 

>Make sure you are now on the `learn-complytime/step-2` branch.

**BEFORE**: `main` branch

<img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/mainbranch.png" width="500"/>

**AFTER**: `learn-complytime/step-2` branch

<img alt="img_1.png" height="300" src="images/newbranchimage.png" width="500"/>

#### Making changes in the `markdown/` folder

Navigate to the `markdown` folder. There should be several folders `catalogs`, `profiles`, and `component-definitions`. 

You will make edits to content in the Markdown folder.

<img alt="img.png" height="190" src="images/markdwon.png" width="380"/>


Clicking on Component Definitions there will be RHEL8, RHEL9, and RHEL10 content initialized by `complyscribe`. The folders are organized by `Example-POLICY-level/compdef-title/profile`. This example uses content for the RHEL10 ANSSI Enhanced Example Component Definition.

<img alt="img.png" height="90" src="images/try.png" width="350"/>


Example Markdown for RHEL10 ANSSI Control R1: Hardware Support.

[Control R1 in PDF format](https://cyber.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/document/linux_configuration-en-v2.pdf)

<img alt="img.png" height="105" src="images/frompdf.png" width="400"/>

Markdown version of Control R1 from `rhel10-anssi-enhanced` OSCAL Profile.

<img alt="img.png" height="250" src="images/comdefexample.png" width="650"/>

Updates can be made to the Component Definition editable content by clicking the pencil in the top right corner of the `r1.md` file. This is where you must make sure that the branch selected in the top left corner is `learn-complytime/step-2`.

<img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/fixed.png" width="700"/>


This is the step where your knowledge from the Intro to GitHub Skills and Communicate Using Markdown will be important. The "Edit" and "Preview" tabs in the GitHub UI editor will help you check your Markdown work as you go. "Edit" is the Markdown formatted text. "Preview" is the styled format with Markdown applied.

##### EDIT - Markdown format that includes my change "Example control implementation description for control r1. This should be edited as part of Step 2 of the ComplyTime GitHub Skills Discovery."

<img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/previewtesting.png" width="700"/>

##### PREVIEW - styled Markdown format that includes my change "Example control implementation description for control r1. This should be edited as part of Step 2 of the ComplyTime GitHub Skills Discovery."

<img alt="img_1.png" height="300" src="images/fixeditup.png" width="700"/>

#### Git flow

After making a few edits click the green button in the top right corner "Commit Changes." There will be a pop-up window that includes a field for your commit message and the extended description. The description can be left blank or expand on the changes you made to the Markdown. 

> Ensure the "Commit directly to the learn-complytime/step-2 branch" option is selected.

<img alt="img.png" height="440" src="images/primage.png" width="640"/>

Click the green box that says "Commit Changes." Then, click **Code** in the top left corner to go back to the homepage of your repository. There will be a yellow banner that notifies you that your  `learn-complytime/step-2` branch had recent pushes. Click the green box "Compare & pull request."

<img alt="img.png" height="340" src="images/PRalert.png" width="500"/>

Once you click "Compare & pull request" there will be a new screen populated to create your pull request. Ensure that the gray banner indicates `base: main` and `compare: learn-complytime/step-2` for the pull request. This will compare your change to R1: Hardware Support that you made on the `learn-complytime/step-2` branch to the `main` branch which was prior to editing the `r1.md` control implementation.

<img alt="img.png" height="400" src="images/prcompare.png" width="600"/>


The same rules apply for the Add a description box of the Pull Request. The "Write" tab will show the Markdown format. The "Preview" tab shows the styled Markdown format.

<img alt="img.png" src="images/PRformatted.png" width="600" height="380"/>

#### Providing context through Markdown

Update the description with the issue that you opened for taking notes on the course content. Easily link the issue by using the `#` symbol. The Pull Request has a template so you can easily use bullet points, check boxes, and link references in Markdown. 

Click the green "Create pull request" button. This will create a pull request that proposes changes to the `main` branch. Your commit(s) will be shown in the pull request history.

<img alt="img.png" height="500" src="images/createprbutton.png" width="500"/>

#### Checking your work

Result

<img alt="img.png" height="380" src="images/hwoitlooks.png" width="580"/>


Click "Commits." The commit message you chose when editing R1: Hardware Support in `r1.md` should match the commit title in your pull request. Clicking on the commit will let you see the changes you made and any description you added.

<img alt="img.png" height="460" src="images/commitimage.png" width="700"/>

**Commit Preview**

<img alt="img.png" height="100" src="images/fixcommitmessage.png" width="700"/>

Once you have opened the PR your GitHub Issue for the course will **close**. Switching back to the `main` branch, the page will send a Congratulations :tada: and you can keep practicing or revisit your previous work on the GitHub issue by clicking "RETURN TO EXERCISE."

<img alt="img.png" height="400" src="images/congrats.png" width="560"/>

Clicking "RETURN TO EXERCISE" will bring you back to this page. Feel free to keep practicing.
