# ComplyTime GitHub Skills Discovery Manual Steps

> [Prerequisites](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/README.md#prerequisites) must be completed prior to attempting the ComplyTime module

Welcome to the ComplyTime learning course\! This guide will help you navigate the course, which is built on GitHub Skills and uses automated workflows to set up your personalized workspace. You'll use GitHub Issues to keep track of your notes as you progress.

### **Step 1: Dive into the `creme-brulee` Course Documentation**

The very first step in your ComplyTime journey is to thoroughly review the provided `creme-brulee` course documentation. These materials are essential for understanding the project and setting the stage for the rest of your learning.

#### **Taking Notes**

As you go through the documentation, it's highly recommended that you take detailed notes. You'll be required to open a GitHub issue for **Step 2:** Deep dive into oscal-content. Your personal workspace, created by the automated workflows, allows you to use GitHub Issues for taking notes. An example issue can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/issues/7). 

* To document your notes, create a new GitHub Issue.  
* **Important:** When creating your issue, make sure to select the "**Learning course issue template**." This will help you keep your notes organized and consistent. The **Learning course issue template** is formatted and allows you to take notes, test your Markdown skills, and keep your learning organized.  
* You can refer to [this example](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/quickstart) for guidance on how to create an issue.
* The [course_layout.md](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/steps/course_layout.md) details the process for opening issues. 

Good luck with your ComplyTime learning journey\!

### **📝 Take the Self-Assessment**

Once you've thoroughly reviewed all the documentation above, take this short [self-assessment]([https://form.typeform.com/to/tiOAik8G](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdE4qJ3pmWa1SaQoWMiUI9p3ZdB947PbhqZEIFo7nWYdcJ44A/viewform?usp=header)). Good luck\! 🚀

# Step 2: Practice Communicating using Markdown and Git

> You should've completed the _Communicate Using Markdown_ GitHub Skills course as a pre-requisite. 

## What you'll need

After completing [**Step 1:** _Read the docs_](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/.github/steps/1-step.md) you'll need to copy the link to the exercise issue and include it in the Pull request.

Follow the [help guide](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/docs/issue-help.md) for creating issues.

## **Getting Started**

Follow the steps in the [manual_steps.md](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/steps/manual_steps.md) for an in-depth walkthrough and example of editing content in the `markdown/` folder.

1. **Create a New Branch**: In your copy of the learning course, create a new branch named `learn-complytime/step-2`. 
2. **Switch Branches**: Switch to the `learn-complytime/step-2` branch. This is where you'll start working with Git and Markdown.  
3. **Navigate and Review**: Go to the `markdown/` folder and review its contents. You'll find catalogs, profiles, and component definitions that were initialized by `complyscribe`.  
   * **Editing Example**: The in-depth walkthrough in the [course_layout.md](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/steps/course_layout.md) provides an example of editing Markdown in the `markdown/component-definitions/My-Test-Component/My-Test-Component/rhel10-anssi-enhanced/r1/r1.md` file. Use this as a guide to make changes to the control implementations in the Component Definitions. **Directions are hidden until you begin editing the Markdown file.**  
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes to your `learn-complytime/step-2` branch. You can make several commits as you work.  
5. **Open a Pull Request**: Open a Pull Request and update its description to clearly explain the changes you've made in the Markdown files.  
6. **Submit Your Work**: Copy the link to your Pull Request and submit it in the self-assessment.  
7. **Keep Practicing\!**: There's no limit to how many times you can retry this exercise. Simply follow the steps in the [**manual steps**](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/steps/manual_steps.md) again. For additional help, refer to the [**course layout**](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/main/steps/course_layout.md).

## What You'll Submit

The [self-assessment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIXyhvuLdCcKqBewFGggM7I38W7JJ-phbBUIdhJCw0Puz_cg/viewform?usp=header) will require submission of the link to your Pull Request opened for changes to OSCAL Component Definitions. 

Edit a minimum of **three** Component Definitions. Separate each edit by commit. The Pull Request will include all commits published on the `learn-complytime/step-2` branch. When clicking the pencil to edit Markdown files, the hidden instructions will appear.
